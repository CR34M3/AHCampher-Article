Much remains to be done here.  This seems more like an article sketch
than a finished product.  Remember that the article reports on a
particular application of useful results, and is not meant to be an
overall summary of the results of an entire master's dissertation.

Particular points:

Your overview of process operability measures needs to be reworked
significantly to avoid looking like a thrown-together list of Google
hits on operability.  Ideally the methods would be ordered in some
logical way (chronological, computational effort, etc) and discussed
in that order pointing out pros and cons, culminating in the geometric
approach suggestion which addresses some of the cons discussed at the
cost of simplicity.

Many sections suffer from this lack of flow - especially the
conclusions.  Make sure you tie up the conclusions and the abstract.

Nits: 

There are several concorde errors.  Make sure that you use the plural
when multiple authors are named in your citation.  Read the PDF as
well, as the LaTeX code often makes these errors difficult to spot.
